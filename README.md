# Habitica Self-Hosted

Adaptions and infrastructure to facilitate self-hosting of the habit-building program [Habitica](https://habitica.com). It is based on the source code and assets of the [Habitica Repository](https://github.com/HabitRPG/habitica), hence the [LICENSE](https://github.com/HabitRPG/habitica/blob/develop/LICENSE) from there applies here and to the adaptions in this repository as well.

For each release in the Habitica upstream repository, the self-hosting adaptions are automatically applied by rebasing the `self-host` branch onto the last release commit. The Docker images for server and client are built then and pushed to Docker Hub as [awinterstein/habitica-server](https://hub.docker.com/r/awinterstein/habitica-server) and [awinterstein/habitica-client](https://hub.docker.com/r/awinterstein/habitica-client).

## Improvements for Self-Hosting

The following noteworthy changes were applied to the Habitica source code:

- Dockerfile and Github Workflow to create the production containers for hosting
- every user automatically gets a subscription on registration that never needs to be renewed
- locations for buying gems with money were replaced with options to buy with gold (e.g., the quick access in the header)
- group plans can be created without payment
- emails are sent directly via a configured SMTP server instead of using the Mailchimp (Mandrill) web-service
- settings and links (e.g., in the footer) that do not make sense for a self-hosted site were removed
- registrations can be restricted to only invited users via a configuration parameter
- analytics and payment scripts are not loaded

## Limitations

The following things do not work (yet):
- third-party access and scripts are not thoroughly disabled, so there might still be some scripts loaded

Contributions to fix those or other things are very welcome!

## Simple Setup with Docker Compose

Habitica needs a Mongo database, its server component (a NodeJS application) and its client component (a Vue.js application). In the simplest setup for self-hosting, there are two containers started for them, with a dependency from the server (that provides the server and the client component) to the database:

```mermaid
architecture-beta
    group containers(server)[Containers]

    service db(database)[MongoDB] in containers
    service server(server)[Server] in containers

    db:L <-- R:server

    group host(server)[Host]
    service proxy(server)[Reverse Proxy] in host

    proxy{group}:T --> B:server{group}
```

The server port could directly be exposed as port 80 on the host. However, usually a reverse proxy like Nginx would be put in front, that handles HTTPS traffic including TLS certificate handling.

The following Docker Compose file can be used for setting up the containers:

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  server:
    image: docker.io/awinterstein/habitica-server:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    depends_on:
      - mongo
    environment:
      - NODE_DB_URI=mongodb://mongo/habitica # this only needs to be adapted if using a separate database
      - BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3000 # change this to the URL under which your instance will be reachable
      - INVITE_ONLY=false # change to `true` after registration of initial users, to restrict further registrations
      - EMAIL_SERVER_URL=mail.example.com
      - EMAIL_SERVER_PORT=587
      - EMAIL_SERVER_AUTH_USER=mail_user
      - EMAIL_SERVER_AUTH_PASSWORD=mail_password
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    networks:
      - habitica
  mongo:
    image: docker.io/mongo:latest # better to replace 'latest' with the concrete mongo version (e.g., the most recent one)
    restart: unless-stopped
    hostname: mongo
    command: ["--replSet", "rs", "--bind_ip_all", "--port", "27017"]
    healthcheck:
      test: echo "try { rs.status() } catch (err) { rs.initiate() }" | mongosh --port 27017 --quiet
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 30s
      start_period: 0s
      start_interval: 1s
      retries: 30
    volumes:
      - ./db:/data/db:rw
      - ./dbconf:/data/configdb
    networks:
      habitica:
        aliases:
          - mongo
networks:
  habitica:
    driver: bridge
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are planning to run the Habitica containers on a Raspberry Pi 4, you might not be able to use `mongo:latest` (see [issue 20](https://github.com/awinterstein/habitica/issues/20)). In this case you can try to use `mongo:bionic` instead.

## Optimized Setup with Docker Compose

As there's probably a web server running on the host already, acting as a reverse proxy for Habitica, this web server could be used to sever the static client files for Habitica as well.

```mermaid
architecture-beta
    group containers(server)[Containers]
    service db(database)[MongoDB] in containers
    service server(server)[Server] in containers
    db:L <-- R:server

    group host(server)[Host]
    service proxy(server)[Reverse Proxy] in host
    proxy{group}:T --> B:server{group}
    service client(database)[Client Files] in host
    proxy:R --> L:client
```

Or the static client files could be served from a different host (e.g., a static file hosting).
