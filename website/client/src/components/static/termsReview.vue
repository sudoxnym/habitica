    <p>
      SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES. THEREFORE, SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS ON WARRANTIES IN THIS SECTION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL AFFECT ANY NON-WAIVABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS THAT APPLY TO YOU.
    </p>

    <h2>Indemnification</h2>
    <p>
      You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold us and our officers, directors, employees, agents, successors, licensees, licensors, and assigns harmless from and against any damages, liabilities, losses, expenses, claims, actions, and/or demands, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising or resulting from: (i) your breach of any of your representations, warranties or other obligations under this Agreement; (ii) your use or misuse of the Service or content posted or made available by HabitRPG; and/or (iii) your violation of any third-party rights in connection with your use of the Service, including without limitation any copyright, trademark, property, publicity, or privacy right.

We reserve the right to participate in the defense (at our expense) of any matter that is subject to indemnification under this section. In such case, you agree to cooperate with any reasonable requests assisting our defense of such matter.
    </p>

    <h2>Electronic Communications Privacy Act Notice (18 U.S.C. 2701-2711)</h2>
    <p>
      We make no guaranty of confidentiality or privacy with respect to any communication or information transmitted via the Service. We will not be liable for the privacy of the information, e-mail addresses, registration, and identification information, disk space, communications, confidential or trade-secret information, or any other content transmitted over networks accessed by the Service, or otherwise connected with your use of the Service.
    </p>

    <h2>Compliance with Applicable Laws</h2>
    <p>
      The Service is based in the United States. We make no claims concerning whether the Service or posted content may be downloaded, viewed, or be appropriate for use outside of the United States. If you access the Service or such content from outside of the United States, you do so at your own risk. Whether inside or outside of the United States, you are solely responsible for ensuring compliance with the laws of your specific jurisdiction.
    </p>

    <h2>Binding Arbitration</h2>
    <p>
      In the event of a dispute arising under or relating to this Agreement or the Service (each, a "Dispute"), such dispute will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration governed by the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA"). Any election to arbitrate, at any time, shall be final and binding on the other party. NEITHER PARTY SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE SUCH CLAIM IN COURT OR TO HAVE A JURY TRIAL, EXCEPT EITHER PARTY MAY BRING ITS CLAIM IN ITS LOCAL SMALL CLAIMS COURT, IF PERMITTED BY THAT SMALL CLAIMS COURT RULES AND IF WITHIN SUCH COURT'S JURISDICTION. ARBITRATION IS DIFFERENT FROM COURT, AND DISCOVERY AND APPEAL RIGHTS MAY ALSO BE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION.
    </p>
    <p>
      All disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator selected jointly by the parties, whose decision will be final, except for a limited right of appeal under the FAA. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted by JAMS pursuant to its then current Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and in accordance with the Expedited Procedures in those rules, or, where appropriate, pursuant to JAMS' Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures. All applicable JAMS rules and procedures are available at the JAMS website <a
        href="https://www.jamsadr.com"
        target="_blank"
      >www.jamsadr.com</a>. Each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules. Judgment on the arbitrator's award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This clause shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. If conducted in person, the arbitration shall take place in the United States county where you reside. The parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay a proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator. The parties shall cooperate in good faith in the voluntary and informal exchange of all non-privileged documents and other information (including electronically stored information) relevant to the Dispute immediately after commencement of the arbitration. As set forth below, nothing in this Agreement will prevent us from seeking injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction as necessary to protect our proprietary interests.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANY CLAIMS, ACTIONS OR PROCEEDINGS BY YOU MUST BE COMMENCED WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER THE EVENT THAT GAVE RISE TO YOUR CLAIM OCCURS. ALL OTHER CLAIMS YOU MAY HAVE ARE PERMANENTLY BARRED.
    </p>

    <h2>Class Action Waiver</h2>
    <p>
      You agree that any arbitration or proceeding shall be limited to the Dispute between us and you individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (i) no arbitration or proceeding shall be joined with any other; (ii) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated or resolved on a class action-basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (iii) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons. YOU AGREE THAT YOU MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST US ONLY IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
    </p>

    <h2>Jury Trial Waiver</h2>
    <p>
      IF FOR ANY REASON A DISPUTE OR CLAIM MAY PROCEED IN COURT RATHER THAN IN ARBITRATION, EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR THE SERVICE (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR ANY OTHER THEORY), UNLESS SUCH WAIVERS ARE UNENFORCEABLE.
    </p>

    <h2>Equitable Relief</h2>
    <p>
      You acknowledge and agree that in the event of a breach or threatened violation by you of our intellectual property rights and/or rights related to our confidential and proprietary information, we will suffer irreparable harm and will therefore be entitled to injunctive relief to enforce this Agreement. We may, without waiving any other remedies under this Agreement, seek from any court having jurisdiction any interim, equitable, provisional, or injunctive relief that is necessary to protect our rights and property pending the outcome of the arbitration referenced above.
    </p>

      <li>If any part of the Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law, including, without limitation, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in effect.</li>
      <li>A printed version of the Agreement and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to the Agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.</li>
