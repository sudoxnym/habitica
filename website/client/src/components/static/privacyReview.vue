      1. Collection of Information
    </h2>
    <p>
      We and our third-party service providers and business partners may collect information from you directly and/or automatically when you visit the Site or use the Services. We and our third-party service providers may also collect information about you from third parties. Some of this information may be considered "personal information" or "personal data" under applicable laws (collectively, “personal information”). We consider information that identifies you as a specific, identified individual (such as your name, phone number, and email address) to be personal information. We also, where required by applicable law, consider additional types of identifying data, like IP addresses and cookie identifiers, to be personal information.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may, in accordance with applicable law, take your personal information and de-identify or pseudonymize it to make it non-personally identifiable, either by combining it with information about other individuals and/or by hashing the information or otherwise removing characteristics that make the information personally identifiable. We maintain and use de-identified or pseudonymized data without attempting to re-identify it, except where permitted by applicable law, such as to determine whether our de-identification processes satisfy legal requirements. We will treat de-identified or pseudonymized information as non-personal to the fullest extent allowed by applicable law.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may collect the following categories of personal information from or about you:
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Identifiers and Contact Information</u>. This category includes names, addresses, telephone numbers, mobile numbers, email addresses, signatures, account names, dates of birth, bank account information, and other similar contact information and identifiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Commercial Information</u>. This category includes, without limitation, products and services purchased, obtained, or considered, or other purchasing or consuming histories or tendencies.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Internet or Other Electronic Network Activity Information</u>. This category includes, without limitation, browsing history, search history, or a consumer’s interactions with a website, application, or advertisement.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Geolocation Data</u>. This category includes, without limitation, location information collected when using our Services.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u>Sensitive Personal Information</u>. This category includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>racial or ethnic origin, citizenship or immigration status, or religious beliefs;</li>
      <li>mental or physical health diagnosis;</li>
      <li>sexual orientation; and</li>
      <li>information collected from a known child.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>
      NOTE: Please do not provide us “sensitive personal information” or “sensitive personal data”, as those terms are defined under applicable privacy laws, unless we directly request that you do so. If you feel, after careful consideration, that it is necessary to provide us certain sensitive personal information or data, please provide us the minimum amount of such information or data that is necessary.
    </strong></p>
    <h3 id="section_1_1">
      1.1 Information You Provide Directly
    </h3>
    <p>
      We may ask you to provide certain personal information when you use the Services. This information may include contact information (such as your name and email), account information (such as your email address and, if you choose to log in through Google or Apple, the associated user ID and email address), transaction information (such as your billing address and mailing address), or user content you choose to upload (such as photos and task lists). Note that all payments are handled by our third-party payment providers who may collect relevant information in order to complete your transaction (such as your payment card, billing address, and phone number). Our current providers are Apple, Google, PayPal, and Stripe. We encourage you to review their respective privacy policies for additional information regarding their privacy practices.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may also ask you to provide the contact information of another individual, such as when you invite another user to the Services. By providing us this information, you represent to us that you do so with the consent of the individual to whom it relates. We will only use this information for the specific reason for which it was provided.
    </p>
    <h3 id="section_1_2">
      1.2 Information We Collect Automatically
    </h3>
    <p>
      We and third-party companies and business partners may use a variety of technologies, including, without limitation, cookies, pixels, embedded scripts, and session events (collectively, “cookies”) that automatically or passively collect certain information whenever you visit our Site, use our Services, or otherwise interact with us or our content (“<strong>Usage Information</strong>”). Usage Information may include the hardware model, browser, and operating system you are using, the URL or advertisement that referred you to the Site you are visiting or Service you are using, all of the areas within the Site that you visit or Services that you use, your time zone, non-precise location information, and mobile network (if applicable), among other information. In addition, we automatically collect your IP address or other unique identifier ("<strong>Device Identifier</strong>") for any computer, mobile phone or other device you use to access our Services. In some cases, we may directly collect location information through your device. You may be able to turn off the collection of location information through the settings on your device. Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but if HabitRPG associates it with you as a specific and identifiable person, HabitRPG treats it as personal information.
    </p>
    <h4>Types of Cookies</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><u>First and Third-Party Cookies</u>. First party cookies are generally placed on your computer or device by the website you are visiting. For example, we may use a first party cookie to improve Site security. Third-party cookies are placed on your computer or device by a source other than the website you are visiting in order to enable third-party features such as advertising, analytics, videos, or interactive content.</li>
      <li><u>Essential or Strictly Necessary Cookies</u>. These cookies are necessary for the Site to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually set in response to actions taken by you which amount to a request for Services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in, or filling in forms.</li>
      <li><u>Performance and Functionality Cookies</u>. Although these are non-essential cookies, they help the Site perform and function as designed. For example, performance and functionality cookies may help the Site display videos, enable chat sessions, or recognize whether you visited the Site before.</li>
      <li><u>Analytics Cookies</u>. These cookies track your usage of the Site. The information these cookies collect can be used for various purposes such as understanding how visitors use the Site, Site and content customization, or advertising and marketing.</li>
      <li><u>Advertising Cookies</u>. Advertising and marketing cookies perform functions such as helping customize your Site experience, personalizing ads based on your online activities and interests, measuring the effectiveness of ads, preventing an ad from reappearing, and serving you targeted advertisements. Information from these cookies may be disclosed to third parties or third parties may place these cookies on your computer or device. Advertising and marketing cookies may track your online activities.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The Site uses essential, functional, and performance cookies to function and perform as designed; analytics cookies to understand how you use the Site, improve its functionality, and other related purposes; and advertising cookies to help us with our advertising and marketing activities. We and our third-party partners and service providers may collect and track information about your online activities over time and across different websites, applications, and devices.
    </p>
    <h4>Google Analytics</h4>
    <p>
      We use Google Analytics, a service which uses cookies to collect and analyze data about the use of the Services and report on activities and trends. This service may also collect data about the use of other websites, apps, and online services. You can <a
        href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites"
        target="_blank"
      >learn about</a> Google's practices, and opt out of them, by downloading the <a
        href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout"
        target="_blank"
      >Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on</a>.
    </p>
    <h4>Controlling Cookies</h4>
    <p>
      You may control cookies, including preventing or stopping the installation and storage of cookies, through your browser settings and other tools. Most browsers will allow you to block or refuse cookies. However, you may need to manually adjust your preferences each time you visit a site. For more information, see the Help section of your browser. Please note that if you block certain cookies, some of the services and functionalities of our Site may not work.
    </p>
    <p class="important">
      IMPORTANT: BY USING THE SITE, YOU CONSENT TO THE PROCESSING OF ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION FOR THE PURPOSES AND FUNCTIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE.
    </p>
    <h4>Do Not Track</h4>
    <p>
      “Do Not Track” is a privacy preference that you can set in your Internet search browser that sends a signal to a website that you do not want the website operator to track certain browsing information about you. However, because our Site is not configured to detect Do Not Track signals from a user’s computer, we are unable to respond to Do Not Track requests.
    </p>
    <h3 id="section_1_3">
      1.3 Location Data
    </h3>
    <p>
      We do not collect your precise location. However, please note that we may still be able to collect or infer your approximate location through other information we collect, such as IP address. In addition, some mobile service providers may also provide us or our third-party service providers with information regarding the non-precise physical location of the device you use to access our Services.
    </p>
    <h3 id="section_1_4">
      1.4 Information Collected By and/or Disclosed to Third Parties
    </h3>
    <p>
      We may receive information about you from third parties. For example, you may have the opportunity to log in through or otherwise connect your Apple and Google accounts. Additionally, when you interact with us through social media, you will be choosing to share information about your interactions with HabitRPG with that social media service.
    </p>

Disclosed To</strong>"), and the categories of third parties to which we may sell it for monetary value or other valuable consideration or share it for cross-context behavioral advertising/targeted marketing ("<strong>C.

      11. Jurisdiction-Specific Rights
    </h2>
    <p><strong><u>California, Nebraska, and Texas Residents</u></strong></p>
    <p>
      This section applies only to California, Nebraska, and Texas residents. It supplements and amends the information contained in the Policy with respect to such individuals. The other provisions of the Policy continue to apply, except as modified in this section.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Shine the Light [California residents only]</em>. California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits you to request information regarding the disclosure of your personal information by us to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Such requests must be submitted to us in accordance with the instructions in the Contact Us section of this Policy. Please mention when contacting us that you are making a “California Shine the Light” inquiry. Within 30 days of receiving such a request, we will provide a list of the categories of personal information disclosed to third parties for third-party direct marketing purposes during the immediately preceding calendar year, along with the names and addresses of these third parties. This request may be made no more than once per calendar year. We reserve our right not to respond to requests submitted other than in accordance with the instructions specified in this paragraph.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Eraser Law [California residents only]</em>. If you are a California resident under the age of 18, and a registered user of any site where this policy is posted, California law permits you to request and obtain removal of content or information you have publicly posted. You may submit your request using the contact information at the end of this Policy. Please be aware that such request does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or information you have posted and that there may be circumstances in which the law does not require or allow removal even if requested.
    </p>
    <p>
      <u><em>Your Rights</em></u>
    </p>
    <p>
      You may have certain rights related to your personal information, subject to certain exceptions (including, as applicable and without limitation, safety, security, and protecting the rights of other users). Specifically:
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Right to Confirm and Access</em>. You may have the right to request that we confirm whether we process your personal information and, if we do, that we grant you access to that information. If you previously provided us your personal information, and that information is available in a digital format, you may have the right to obtain a copy of the information in a portable and, to the extent technically feasible, readily usable format that allows you to transmit the information to another person without hindrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Right to Delete</em>. You may have the right to request that we delete your personal information from our records, subject to certain exceptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Right to Correct</em>. You may have the right, subject to certain limitations, to request that we correct any inaccurate personal information we maintain about you.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Opt - Out of the “ Sale” of Personal Information or Use of Such Information for “Targeted Advertising” or “Profiling”</em>. We engage in common marketing and advertising practices to provide more relevant content and ads to users of our Site and Services. Certain of these practices may involve the “selling” of personal information, or the use of such information for “targeted advertising” or “profiling,” as those terms are defined in the Texas Data Privacy and Security Act (“TDPSA”) and the Nebraska Data Privacy Act. We do not sell personal information under the more commonly understood meaning of that word—i.e., providing personal information to third parties in exchange for money. Nor do we have actual knowledge of selling personal information of minors under the age of 16. To opt-out of the selling of your personal information, or use of that information for targeted advertising or profiling, please submit a request to <a href="mailto:privacy@habitica.com">privacy@habitica.com</a>. Note: We also treat Global Privacy Control browser signals as opt-out of sale/disclosure for targeted advertising or profiling requests. To opt-out via the Global Privacy Control, please follow the instructions available <a
        href="https://globalprivacycontrol.org/"
        target="_blank"
      >here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Right to Consent to Use or Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information</em>. Where required by applicable law, we will process your sensitive personal information only with your consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Right Against Discrimination</em>. You have the right not to be discriminated against for exercising any of the rights described in this section. For example, we generally will not provide you a different level or quality of goods or services if you exercise these rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Submitting Data Subject Rights Requests</em>. To submit a data subject rights request, please email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@habitica.com">privacy@habitica.com</a>. We reserve the right to only respond to verifiable requests. To verify your identity, we may ask you to verify personal information we already have on file for you. If we cannot verify your identity from the information we have on file, we may request additional information from you, which we will only use to verify your identity, and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. You will need to describe your request with sufficient detail to allow us to review, understand, assess, and respond to it, and we may not be able to respond to your request, or provide you with personal information, if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. You may authorize another person to act on your behalf with respect to your rights under this section. We reserve the right to deny requests from persons claiming to be authorized agents that do not submit sufficient proof of their authorization.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Our Response</em> . You may have the right, subject to applicable law, to submit up to two (2) requests per year free of charge. We reserve the right to charge a fee to process or respond to your request if it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that a request warrants a fee, we will attempt to notify you as to why we made that decision and provide a cost estimate before completing your request. We will endeavor to respond to verifiable requests within forty-five (45) calendar days of receipt, but we may require an extension of up to forty-five (45) additional calendar days to respond and we will notify you of the need for the extension.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by email. In the event we deny your request, in whole or in part, we will explain the bases for that denial.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Appeal of Our Response</em>. In the event you believe we have erroneously denied your request, in full or in part, you may, within 60 days of receipt of that denial, submit an appeal to <a href="mailto:privacy@habitica.com">privacy@habitica.com</a>. In your appeal submission, please explain why you believe our decision to deny your request was incorrect and please provide any additional information you believe we should consider in connection with your appeal. Within 60 days of receipt of your appeal, we will advise you in writing of any action we have taken, or refrained from taking, in response to your appeal, along with an explanation of why we have taken, or refrained from taking, such action.
